<h1>Regression Algorithms on Titanic Dataset</h1>
<h3>In this we performed 5 regression algorithms on 'Titanic Dataset'.<br>
The regression algorithms used are: </h3>
<ul>
<li><h3>Logistic Regression :</h3> The accuraccy of the model is 89.05%</li>
<li><h3>Decision Tree Regression :</h3> The accuraccy of the model is 87.64%</li>
<li><h3>Support Vector Regression :</h3> The accuraccy of the model is 88.68%</li>
<li><h3>Ridge Regression :</h3> The accuraccy of the model is 88.46%</li>
<li><h3>Lasso Regression :</h3> The accuraccy of the model is 88.42%</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><br>
<h4>After training the model, we observe Logistic Regression with the highest accuracy(89.05%). We conclude that Logistic Regression was the most accurate regression algorithm with respect to the model.</h4>
